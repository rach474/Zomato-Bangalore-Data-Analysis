Description:
The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea of the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurant at different places in Bengaluru, aggregate rating of each restaurant, Bengaluru being one such city has more than 12,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world. With each day new restaurants opening the industry hasn’t been saturated yet and the demand is increasing day by day. In spite of increasing demand it however has become difficult for new restaurants to compete with
established restaurants. Most of them serving the same food. Bengaluru being the IT capital of India. Most of the people here are dependent mainly on the restaurant food as they don’t have time to cook for themselves. With such an overwhelming demand of restaurants it has therefore become important to study the demography of a location. What kind of a food is more popular in a locality? Do the entire locality loves vegetarian food. This kind of analysis can be done using the data, by studying factors such as
• Location of the restaurant
• Approx Price of food
• Theme-based restaurant or not
• Which locality of that city serves that cuisines with the maximum number of restaurants
• The needs of people who are striving to get the best cuisine of the neighbourhood
• Is a particular neighbourhood famous for its own kind of food.
What I Had Done:

* Cleaning the data and transforming it to be useful for basic analysis.
* Visual Data exploration.
Libraries Needed:
* Pandas- To manipulate Dataframes.
* Seaborn- To visualize data
* Matplotlib- To visualize data
Conclusions:
* Majority of the restaurants provide online order facility.
* Very few of the restaurants provide book order facility.
* The maximum rating of restaurants having online order facilities is higher (around 4.8) than restaurants not having online order facilities (around 4.2). The average rating is almost same for both types of restaurants.
* The average rating of restaurants having book table facilities is higher (around 4.2) than restaurants not having book table facilities (around 3.7).

* There are a high number of ‘Delivery’ and ‘Dine-out’ types of restaurants in most of the locations and lesser ‘Buffet’, ‘Drinks & nightlife’ and ‘Pubs and bars’ types of restaurants.
* Restaurants in Koramangala 5th Block, Indiranagar, Koramangala 4th Block etc get a good number of customer feedbacks¶
* North Indian, Chinese and South Indian cuisines have got the highest number of votes. Therefore people are interested more in these types of cuisines.
